# Final-Project
This is my first HTML and CSS code. 
I made a basic Golf World web-site.

The Tee Times page is supposed to be able to book tee times. I to learn JavaScript or some form of data capturing. 

The same go's for the Contacts page and on the About page there is a button that needs to be activated.
